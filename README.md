Ruportal

No, it doesn't include Ruports... yet(?)
But the name was just too good to pass up.

TODO:

 * finish this README (@mojombo's RDD)
 * pagination of results
 * result set can be an array of arrays (first row is column names)
 * transform column function
   * create links from data
   * apply class to cell for styling
 * embed within a rails app
   * including using the app's layout
 * use ruports
   * export to PDF, CSV, XLS
   * nice irb view (fixed width tables)
